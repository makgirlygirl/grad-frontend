        question:"다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?", 
        new_passage:`Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon have suggested that there are two possible alternatives among philosophical theories of explanation.
        One is the view that scientific explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations.
        According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena.
        Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained.
        The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest.
        This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them.
        That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities.`,

        new_passage:`Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon have suggested that there are two possible alternatives among philosophical theories of explanation.
        One is the view that scientific explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations.
        According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena.
        Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained.
        The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest.
        This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them.
        That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities.`,
